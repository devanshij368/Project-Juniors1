       Acrylic nails are one of the most popular nail trends because they are strong, long-lasting,
            and very customizable. They are made by combining a liquid monomer and powder polymer to
            create a hard protective layer over natural nails.

       Many people choose acrylic nails because they can be shaped into different styles such as
            square, coffin, almond, or stiletto. They are perfect for bold designs, long lengths,
            and creative nail art.
      
    </p>
       Acrylic nails are commonly worn for special events, vacations, or when someone wants
            their nails to stand out. With proper care and regular fills, acrylic nails can last
            several weeks.
