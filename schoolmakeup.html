        School makeup focuses on light, simple, and appropriate styles that
        enhance natural features without being distracting. The goal is to look
        neat, fresh, and confident while still keeping makeup minimal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common school makeup products include light foundation or concealer,
        mascara, lip balm or lip gloss, and soft blush. Heavy contouring or bold
        colors are usually avoided to keep the look natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neutral shades such as beige, soft pink, and light brown are popular
        because they work well in a school environment and suit many skin tones.
      </p>

      <p>
        School makeup is designed to be quick and easy to apply, making it
        perfect for busy mornings while still looking polished throughout the day.
